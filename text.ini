intro = Be sure to configure at least one Top up event, since that realizes the main idea of the service. Annulment day and Reminders configuration are optional.

        Basic config example:
        Set daily basis and choose the desired size for the Top up. Set time to 0:00.
        Configure annulment to the day of the month when your salary arrives.
        Set a daily reminder to 20.00 (it will only send reminders if there were no expenses provided after the last Top up)


menu = Choose the event you would like to set up:
       T) add Top up event
       A) add Annulment day
       R) add Reminder

replenishment_intro = Now, we shall configure the replenishment event (or events). That denotes how often and for how much will your balance be refilled with.
                      For example, you can set the 'daily' replenishment basis and set time to '0:00'.
                      This means, that Budgenator will top up your balance daily at midnight, for the chosen replenishment size.
                      Alternatively, you can adjust the budget to be refilled once a week, or, for instance, 3 times a month. In order to do so, just choose the 'day of the month' basis and pick up the days.

        D) Daily basis (every day at certain time)
