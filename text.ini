welcome = Welcome to Budgenator, your personal financial assistant, designed to help you manage your budget with ease.
          If you are looking for a convenient way to keep track of expenses, Budgenator is here to guide you every step of the way.

overview = Set the Balance Top up:
           Decide how often and how much you want to add to your budget balance.
           You can adjust it to top up the balance on a daily basis, on certain day of the week or a specific day of the month.

           Track Your Expenses:
           Simply send the messages every time you spend or all at once and Budgenator will deduct then from your balance.

           Set Reminders:
           You can schedule reminders to be sent, if no expenses were registered, to always keep the balance up to date.

           Annulment Days:
           To keep your budget fresh and focused, set annulment days. These are the days when Budgenator will sum up your period's results, send you a detailed report, and restart your budget."
           Perfect for aligning with your salary days or any other regular incomes.

[config]
intro = Be sure to configure at least one Top up event, since that realizes the main idea of the service. Annulment day and Reminders configuration are optional.

        Basic config example:
        Set daily basis and choose the desired size for the Top up. Set time to 0:00.
        Configure annulment to the day of the month when your salary arrives.
        Set a daily reminder to 20.00 (it will only send reminders if there were no expenses provided after the last Top up)


menu = Choose the event you would like to set up:
       T) add Top up event
       A) add Annulment day
       R) add Reminder

replenishment = Now, we shall configure the replenishment event (or events). That denotes how often and for how much will your balance be refilled with.
                For example, you can set the 'daily' replenishment basis and set time to '0:00'.
                This means, that Budgenator will top up your balance daily at midnight, for the chosen replenishment size.
                Alternatively, you can adjust the budget to be refilled once a week, or, for instance, 3 times a month. In order to do so, just choose the 'day of the month' basis and pick up the days.

basis = Choose the basis out of the numbered options:
        D) Daily basis (every day at certain time)
        W) Weekly basis (on a specific weekday)
        M) Monthly basis (on a specific day of the month)

day_of_the_week = Choose the day of the week.

day_of_the_month = Enter the day of the month. An integer from 1 to 31. Keep in mind, that for choices over 28, the event will not be triggered, if the current month does not contain that day.
day_of_the_month_wrong_input = Incorrect input for the day of the month! Please enter a valid number between 1 and 31.

time = Please, enter the time in HH:MM format.
time_wrong_input = Incorrect time format. Please use HH:MM format (H for hours, M for minutes). For example: 23:30

not_configured = The configuration can not be finished, until you set up at least 1 top up event.
terminated =  The configuration can not be finished, since the dialogue maintenance has already been terminated. Please start a new chat
success = Configuration successfully saved!
